# Space Warrior (Python Game)

A simple 2D game inspired by Space Invaders and Galaga, fully written in Python using the Pygame library. The game was made using:
* Python 3.11.0
* Pygame 2.5.2

To build the game, you can use Pyinstaller or a similar package.

# How to Play
**Goal:** Shoot and destroy all the enemy spaceships while dodging their bullets.

**Controls:**
* Move (x-axis only): Mouse position
* Shoot: Left-click

**Extra:** Sometimes, an enemy will drop a Collectible when killed, which increases the player's score or bullet level.
